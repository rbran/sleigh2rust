## Sleigh2Rust

The Sleigh2Rust project converts the Ghidra Sleigh code into rust code, capable
of disassemble and (in the future) emulate multiple cpu architetures. It plan to
accomplish that by using the lib [sleigh-rs](https://github.com/rbran/sleigh-rs).

An output example of this project can be found on [sleigh3rust](https://github.com/rbran/sleigh3rust).
